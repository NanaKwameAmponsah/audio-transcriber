Audio Transcribe is a full-stack web application designed to convert audio files into accurate text transcriptions using OpenAI's Whisper model. The project features a modern React frontend for seamless user interaction, enabling users to upload audio files and view real-time transcription results. The backend is built with Spring Boot and integrates with OpenAI's Whisper API via Spring AI, handling file uploads, API communication, and secure CORS configuration. The backend was containerized with Docker and deployed on Render for scalable, cloud-based operation, while the frontend was deployed on Netlify for fast, global content delivery. Key contributions include designing RESTful APIs, implementing secure environment-based configuration, orchestrating end-to-end integration between the frontend, backend, and AI services, and managing cloud deployments for robust, production-ready audio transcription workflows.
